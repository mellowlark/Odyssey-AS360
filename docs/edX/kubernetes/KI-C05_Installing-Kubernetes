KI Chapter 5: Installing Kubernetes

Objective
=========
    Discuss Kubernetes configuration options.
    Discuss infrastructure considerations before installing Kubernetes.
    Discuss infrastructure choices for a Kubernetes cluster deployment.
    Review Kubernetes installation tools and certified solutions.

Kubernetes Configuration (options)
==================================
All-in-One Single-Node Installation
    Everything you need in one node for testing and practice.

Single-Control Plane and Multi-Worker Installation
    Uses stacked etcd (etcd runs inside the node)

Single-Control Plane with Single-Node etcd, and Multi-Worker Installation
    etcd is external to the **cluster** formed by the nodes that run control plane components

Multi-Control Plane and Multi-Worker Installation
    HA install with stacked etcd

Multi-Control Plane with Multi-Node etcd, and Multi-Worker Installation
    HA install with external etcd.

More info:
etcd stacked vs external.
https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/ha-topology/
**remember etcd is the database that keeps track the state of the cluster and notes**


Infrastructure for Kubernetes Installation
==========================================
Once Kubernetes has been moved to production decisions need to be made on infrastructure.
    Bare metal, public, private or hybrid cloud.
    Underlying OS and which Distro.
    Networking (which CNI)

Installing Local Learning Clusters
==================================
A new one seems to turn up every day. Here's a few that seem to have gained popularity.
Many of them seem to be released by Linux Distros, Ubuntu, Red Hat, Fedora, etc....

    Minikube: As the name suggests it is a good learning tool that can be installed on a single host.
    Kind: cluster deployed in Dockeer containers that act as nodes.
    Docker Desktop: (Free for personal use) Includes a Kubernetes option.
    Podman Desktop: Red Hat's answer to Docker Desktop.
    MicroK8s: Another lightweight Kubernetes option. It's From Canonical which backs several open soure projects including Ubuntu.
    k3s: Lightweight Kubernetes started by Rancher and transfered to CNCF.
    I believe Rancher has it's own container desktop option now as well.
    k0s: Another lightweight auto installer. Not a lot of documentation though.

NOTE Kubernetes is knowns as K8s as in K(8 letters)s. Many of the names are plays on that.

Installing Production Clusters with Deployment Tools
====================================================
Again there are several tools for setting up a true production Kubernetes install.

    kubeadm: probably the most well known option. (kubeadm does not provision the hosts)
      It can also be used to configure a single-node cluster.
    kubespray: (formerly known as kargo). Seems to be for true Kubernetes infrastructure. AWS, GCP, Azure, etc....
    kobs: Seems to be a newer player, as it only officiallly supports AWS and GCE. Others are in various stages of support.
    Kubernetes The Hard Way: Not a tool but rather a guide to installing Kubernetes manually.
      Probably worth a look to at least get a complete look at the Kubernetes enviroment.
    https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way
      The Hard Way is optimized for learning, which means taking the long route to ensure you understand each task required to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster.


Production Clusters from Certified Solutions Providers
======================================================
With growing popularity comes people looking to make  a dollar.
As of whenever this course was written, there are 200+ managed Kubernetes services providers.

Kubernetes on Windows
=====================
Semi-recently Kubernetes provided a means for running worker nodes on Windows
There are no plans to add control node support. That still needs to be run on Linux.
Scheduling Windows pods to run on Windows and Linux pods to run on Linux is up to the end user.
But Linix and windows containers can coexist in the same cluster.
