KI Chapter 7. Accessing Minikube

Overview
========

In this chapter, we will learn about different methods of accessing a Kubernetes cluster.

We can use a variety of external clients or custom scripts to access our cluster for administration purposes. We will explore kubectl as a CLI tool to access the Minikube Kubernetes cluster, the Kubernetes Dashboard as a web-based user interface to interact with the cluster, and the curl command with proper credentials to access the cluster via APIs.

Learning Objectives
===================

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

    Compare methods to access a Kubernetes cluster.
    Access the Minikube Kubernetes cluster with kubectl.
    Access the Minikube Kubernetes cluster from the Dashboard.
    Access the Minikube Kubernetes cluster via APIs.

Accessing Minikube
==================

Any healthy running Kubernetes cluster can be accessed via any one of the following methods:

    Command Line Interface (CLI) tools and scripts
    Web-based User Interface (Web UI) from a web browser
    APIs from CLI or programmatically

These methods are applicable to all Kubernetes clusters.

Accessing Minikube: Command Line Interface
==========================================
CLI
---
kubectl is the primary Kubernetes command line interface client.
It is a stand alone tool. Does not need to be installed execpt maybe to add it to the path for easier access.
Many other tools have a copy of kubectl wraped inside of them.
minikube kubectl -- for example. For some reason a -- is requred after kubectl. minkube kubectl --
Seems easier to just download it and run it directly
